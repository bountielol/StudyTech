            <p>The assignment seemed simple; Make a video in which you answer the following questions:</p> 
            <p>1. Why do you find the subject Smart Industry interesting?<br>2. What do you want to do with this subject?<br> 3. What relevant skills and knowledge, related to this subject, do you already have? And in which subjects do you want to improve?<br>4. Who do you need as a working partners and how are you going to find them?</p>

            <p>1. Why do you find the subject Smart Industry interesting? <br>The most interesting part about Smart Industry is seeing the technologies evolve. Everything gets smarter. Lifes gets easier, but in the end is it actually safe? <br> 2. What do you want to do with this subject?<br>The things I want to do with this subject are; Check if the new smart technologies being created are secure. Meaning checking if all the data is encrypted and the systems aren’t hackable. And expand my knowledge about Business and management.<br>3. What relevant skills and knowledge, related to this subject, do you already have? And in which subjects do you want to improve?<br>I already have a background in information technology. I can understand most programming, setup a website and database. And host them. Cloud technologies are also up my ally. I have worked with them before. In a project I even created my own private cloud. I do not have much experience in business management. I would like to learn how companies implement new smart technologies and what steps they take if they got their eye on new interesting smart technology.<br>
            4. What type of person do you need as your project partner?<br>As my project partner I will need someone with experience in information technologies but most of all someone who knows all the ins and outs about business management.<br> I think this will help me in my learning process and will make the project come to a good conclusion.<p>
